# 52!

![52 Factorial Project](images/site.jpg)

A collaborative counter demonstrating the mind-boggling scale of 52 factorial (52!). The project educates visitors about the astronomical number of ways to arrange a deck of 52 cards‚Äîeach shuffle creates an order that has almost certainly never existed before in the history of the universe.

Users can click a shared counter that ticks toward 52!, with the count updating live for all visitors simultaneously. The site illustrates just how impossible it would be to reach this number: even with 60,000 people clicking once per second nonstop, it would take 426,275,659 √ó 10‚Åµ‚Åµ years to count to 52 factorial.

One of the key engineering challenges was designing the system to handle the load of many users clicking as rapidly as possible while maintaining synchronization across all connected clients.
